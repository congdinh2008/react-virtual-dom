## Overview

This application allows users to manage milk products in a virtual marketplace. Users can add new products, filter and search existing ones, and track order quantities.

Key features:
- Add new milk products with details, including image selection
- Search and filter products by various criteria
- Toggle between different visual styles based on product quality
- Count-based ordering system for each product
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

- **React 19** - Frontend library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** - Fast development environment and build tool

## React and Virtual DOM

### What is React Virtual DOM?

The React Virtual DOM is a key concept that makes React efficient and powerful. It's a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM that React maintains behind the scenes.

#### How Virtual DOM Works in our Milk Market App

1. **Initial Rendering**: When our app first loads, React creates a Virtual DOM tree representing our UI components (like the `Item` and `List` components).

2. **State Changes**: When users interact with our app (e.g., adding a new milk product or filtering the list):
   - The state is updated (e.g., `setItems([...items, newMilk])`)
   - React creates a new Virtual DOM tree reflecting these changes
   - React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (a process called "diffing")
   - Only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM

3. **Efficient Updates**: In our app, this is visible when:
   - Adding a new milk product only re-renders that specific part of the list
   - Toggling the "Hiển thị phân biệt theo chất lượng" checkbox only updates the styling without reloading all items
   - Filtering products only updates the visible items without affecting the entire page

### Example from Our Code

In our app, when a user changes the filter options:

```jsx
// When a user changes the quality filter
const [qualityFilter, setQualityFilter] = useState('all');

// Later in the code...
onChange={(e) => setQualityFilter(e.target.value)}
```

Instead of manually updating the DOM to show different products, React:
1. Updates the state variable `qualityFilter`
2. Creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting this change
3. Compares it to the previous Virtual DOM
4. Updates only the necessary DOM elements to display the filtered list

This process is much more efficient than directly manipulating the DOM, especially for complex UIs like our product list with multiple filtering options.
